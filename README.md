# OpenGL based Render Engine
This project is an [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/) based render engine with linux and windows support the goal is to be feature rich and cross compilable.

# cmake
- This is supposed to use cmake but we will see how this will go


## Features
- Model loading from obj files that can be created in Blender
- Software based Ray Tracer that runs on all GPUs aiming for biggest compatibility
- basic shaders that can be used for lightning
- loading third party **GLSL** shaders to customize the experience

### Links we used for learning and building
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) from my point of view a good ressource to learn OpenGL and get a grasp of the concepts
- [Scratch Pixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.html) explains a lot about **CG** in genereal and can be usful if you focus on specific aspects
