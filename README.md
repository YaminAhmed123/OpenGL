# OpenGL based Render Engine
This project is an [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/) based render engine with linux and windows support the goal is to be feature rich and cross compilable.


## Features
- Model loading from obj files that can be created in Blender
- Software based Ray Tracer that runs on all GPUs aiming for biggest compatibility
- basic shaders that can be used for lightning
- loading third party **GLSL** shaders to customize the experience
- using Cmake as a cross build tool for windows and linux for easy usage **We will see how this will look in future**

### Links we used for learning and building
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) from my point of view a good ressource to learn OpenGL and get a grasp of the concepts
- [Scratch Pixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.html) explains a lot about **CG** in genereal and can be usful if you focus on specific aspects
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org/) well this is the build tool used for this project.
- [imGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) this is a selfcontained library for creating GUIs

# How to compile ?
## Tut will come in future
